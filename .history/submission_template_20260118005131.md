This function checks if there are orders, then calculates average order value by summing the amounts of all non-cancelled orders and dividing by the number of orders. It correctly excludes cancelled orders from the calculation and only count the non cancelled orders for average. If all the orders got cancelled, the average retuned by the function will be 0.
